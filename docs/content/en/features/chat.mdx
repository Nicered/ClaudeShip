# AI Chat

The AI Chat is your primary interface for building applications with ClaudeShip. Describe what you want in natural language, and watch AI write code for you.

## How It Works

```

│      • Username/email input         │
│      • Password field               │
│      • Submit button                │
│      • Form validation              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. Type your request in the chat input
