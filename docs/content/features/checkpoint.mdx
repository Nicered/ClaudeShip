# Checkpoints

Git-based checkpoint system for easy rollback. Create snapshots of your work and restore to any previous state with one click.

## Features

### Auto-Detect Changes

ClaudeShip automatically detects when you have uncommitted changes. The checkpoint panel shows "Unsaved changes" when files are modified.

### Create Checkpoint

1. Make changes to your project
2. Click the **Checkpoint** tab
3. Enter a checkpoint message
4. Click **Save**

### Timeline View

See all your checkpoints in a chronological timeline:
- Checkpoint message
- Time since creation
- Files changed count
- Insertions (+) and deletions (-)

### Diff Viewer

Click any checkpoint to see:
- List of changed files
- File status (added/modified/deleted)
- Line-by-line diff
- Color-coded changes

### Restore

Rollback to any checkpoint:
1. Click a checkpoint in the timeline
2. Review the diff
3. Click **Restore** button
4. Confirm the restore

## Checkpoint Information

Each checkpoint tracks:
- **Hash**: Git commit hash
- **Message**: Your description
- **Timestamp**: When created
- **Files Changed**: Number of files modified
- **Insertions**: Lines added
- **Deletions**: Lines removed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Enter | Create checkpoint (when message is focused) |

## Best Practices

- Write descriptive checkpoint messages
- Create checkpoints before major changes
- Review diff before restoring
- Use checkpoints instead of manual Git commands

## Difference from Git

Checkpoints are built on Git but simplified:
- No need to use terminal
- No branch management
- No merge conflicts
- One-click restore

However, you can still use standard Git commands in your project if needed!
